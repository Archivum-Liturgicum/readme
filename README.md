Laudetur Iesus Christus! Semper Laudetur!

Welcome to "Archivum Liturgicum Sacrosanctae Romanae Ecclesiae" project. This project is a complete online archive of all the various texts of the traditional Roman Catholic liturgy, also with some precious resources, including articles about the traditional Latin liturgy by the Late Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI.

The primary aim of this project is to make available in electronic form some of the major texts of the traditional Latin liturgy of the Roman Catholic church,  for the use of Catholic traditionalists and liturgical scholars. It will also make available other information and texts which are thought to be useful for the promotion of the Roman Catholic tradition.

The "Archivum Liturgicum Sacrosanctae Romanae Ecclesiae" project is dedicated to Our Lord and His Immaculate Mother and is under the patronage of St. Josemaría Escrivá and Bl. Carlo Acutis. It is also dedicated to all those priests and bishops who have ensured that the traditional Latin liturgy continues to be celebrated.

The founder and webmaster of the "Archivum Liturgicum Sacrosanctae Romanae Ecclesiae" project are Mr. Chavez Cyrillus Mariae Poon C.S.P, he is a member of the Confraternity of St. Peter, and an experienced Altar Server and Master of Ceremonies in Hong Kong. Mr. Poon has a lot of passion for the traditional Roman Catholic liturgy and has a lot of experience in serving the Solemn Mass and various liturgies.
